- **Title/Message:** *Fixed Headlight Detection Program*

### Why This Commit Is Important
This commit represents my most significant contribution to the repository.  
I debugged and fixed the **Headlight Detection Program**, which was previously not functioning correctly.  

**Key Contributions:**
- Refactored `Headlight Detection/headlightDetection.py`  
  â†’ *111 insertions, 27 deletions* to improve stability and accuracy.  
- Generated new working processed image outputs:  
  - `Car Headlight_blur.png`  
  - `Car Headlight_contours.png`  
  - `Car Headlight_gray.png`  
  - `Car Headlight_thresh.png`  
- Ensured compatibility on **macOS** and confirmed that the program now runs end-to-end without errors.  

### Impact
This fix was critical because it turned a broken feature into a working one. The headlight detection program now correctly processes input images, outputs usable visual results, and provides a foundation for future improvements. This contribution directly improved the functionality and reliability of the project.
